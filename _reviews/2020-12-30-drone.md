#### Our Take

I've always had a fascination with flight. I used to have an RC plane when I was younger and even built one myself from scratch once (it never took off). I've always been skeptical of drones, however. Something about the buzzing and hovering made me think it would be easy to fly, maybe not as enjoyable.

But it seems the whole world was waking up to them. Everywhere you look, people are flying or talking about drones. So I decided to pick one up this summer to see what the fuss was all about.

I got this Snaptain A15H because it was affordable, compact and has good battery life. I can confidently say now that IT WAS WORTH THE HYPE! This thing is fun! Here's my take:

- **Easy to fly**: Snaptain has really worked on their hardware and software to make it dead simple to fly. You can take off with the press of a button and there are 3 modes of flying, including a beginner-friendly mode.
- **Really is compact**: When folded, this thing can easily fit into a backpack for easy storage and transport.
- **Includes spare parts**: This was a must for me -- I wound up running into a tree (my fault) within the first 10 minutes and had to replace a propellor. Thankfully the kit included several spares.
- **Long battery life**: I've been able to get 10-12 minutes from a single charge, which seems exceptionally good for a drone this size.

This is one of those impulse purchases that you will not regret. If you have any interest in flying or drones, pick one of these bad boys up!!
