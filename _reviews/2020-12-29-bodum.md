#### Our Take

I've owned at least 5 Bodum French presses over the last decade. This particular model, the Bodum Brazil, is cheap, built tough, and work surprisingly well.

If you're still making drip coffee and/or never tried coffee from a French press before, *you are in for a treat*. Not only does the coffee brew quickly (minutes), but the flavors and textures are richer, bolder and have a lot more depth than your typical cup of drip. Do yourself a favor though and buy a decent pack of beans!

- **Solid construction**: While the main body is glass, I've been impressed by the longevity of the plastic and the mesh filter of the press.
- **Easy to operate**: My dad is old and doesn't like to learn new things -- I was able to teach him how to make a great cup of coffee with this in a matter of minutes.
- **Best with good beans**: You really need to invest in quality coffee to take full advantage of this thing. You will be sent to coffee flavortown!

This is an absolute must-have for any coffee lover. It's great as a gift and even if you have one already, it never hurts to have a spare.
