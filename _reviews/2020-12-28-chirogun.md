#### Our Take

This is the first massage gun I've owned. After dealing with chronic muscle pain for the last 2 years, I decided to see what all the rage was. I picked one up from Amazon last month. It's one of the few purchases I've made where I've used the product nearly every day!

- **The device itself is well built**: While it's made of plastic, it doesn't feel cheap or plastic-y. I feel like I can drop it from a reasonable distance without much consequence.
- **It comes with a softshell case**: I love the idea of being able to travel with this thing without having to worry about it getting lost in my luggage.
- **It includes a million attachments**: This is probably my favorite part -- this thing comes with a dozen different attachments you can stick on the gun to change the angle and effect of the massage.
- **Battery lasts forever**: I've only charged it fully twice so far and have used it for over at least one week at a time (roughly 10 minute sessions)

If you're in the market for a massage gun or know someone who is athletic or prone to injury, this is a holiday gift they will undoubtedly love!
