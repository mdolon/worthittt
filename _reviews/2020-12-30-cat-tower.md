#### Our Take

When I first saw this cat tower, I was nervous that it would be too big and that it would be cheap given the price (around $100). Boy, was I surprised!

This thing is big, sturdy and great quality. And my cats absolutely love it, to boot! (though it did take them a couple of days to warm up to it) The only caveat is that you need to brush it often as it will get covered in cat fur quite easily.

- **Plenty of space**: This thing has more than enough room for 2 cats to play in.
- **Fun to play with**: With all of the nooks and scratch posts, the cats have a lot to keep them engaged.
- **Looks great**: I love the colors on this thing. It fits in very well with the rest of our house.

If you have cats, consider picking up one of these Go Pet Club cat trees, as they will have a blast playing on it!
