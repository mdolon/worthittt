#### Our Take

I picked these gloves up after starting a Muay Thai class last summer. I wanted something that was cheap, looked cool but also had a mesh palm. Believe it or not, it's hard to find boxing gloves that have good ventilationn!

The Sanabul Essential Gel Boxing Gloves were a perfect fit (pun intended) -- they're cushioned, stylish and very, very breathable.

- **Look great**: I get compliments every week with these gloves (especially with the bright orange color)
- **Do not smell**: These gloves have been through sweaty workout after workout and still smell pretty neutral. I will wipe them down occassionaly but otherwise they are left to their own accords.
- **Feel Great**: My Muay Thai sessions typically last an hour and these gloves have never given any discomfort for that entire duration.

These are the best boxing gloves I've owned, and I've been through several pairs of Everlast and other knock-off brands.
