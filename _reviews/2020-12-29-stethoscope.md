#### Our Take

Living in New York City, my partner and I were in the heart of the COVID pandemic. This disease is not only deadly but comes in a variety of forms. We quickly foundn out that safety equipment was sparse and really hard to come by in the city.

After learning that COVID can affect the lungs and give victims pneumonia, we decided to pick up a stethoscope. This would allow us to listen to our lungs to spot any irregularities (my partner has a medical background). This is the best deal we could find.

- **High Quality**: This is not the cheapest stethoscope on the market and the build quality explains why. It's very sturdy and will survive many years of abuse.
- **Easy to use**: There were instructions in the pack and we were able to make sense of them pretty quickly.
- **It includes spare parts**: We actually let our neighbors use this one day and were able to take advantage of the spare parts in order to not contaminate each other.

While you may get more mileage and intel from a Pulse Oximeter, having a stethoscope handy is never a bad idea. Check out this 3M Littman model if you're looking for something high quality and effective!
